This repository contains my personal identity system for NWU Assignment 1.  
It includes my logomark/logotype  and final infographic

## About the Logomark
My logomark shows who I am: creative, analytical, and resilient.  
It’s simple, original, and meaningful, and works well in black and white.

## About the Infographic
The infographic explains my identity and why the logomark looks the way it does.  
It uses one main color and one secondary color, with minimal text for clarity.

## GitHub Integration
This repository is a professional extension of my personal identity, showing my work and process online.
